This application must handle:
- Tables
- Rolls within tables
- Modifiers to tables
- Different levels of objects - Trading posts have several points of interest which each have their own information
- Special result rules. Such as:
-- Reroll if settlement is not bordering a
significant source of water
-- (If you roll for the inn’s quality using the quality
table found in step 3, ignore results that would make
it ‘poor’)
- Ideally store page numbers for tables and optionally print them
- Export to markdown
- Race generation (can steal from other projects)
