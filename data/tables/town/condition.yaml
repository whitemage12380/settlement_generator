  name: Derelict
  description: Buildings may be coming down, or in ruins. Refuse may line the streets,
    which, if they were ever maintained to begin with, are nigh unrecognizable now.
    Everything seems broken, filthy, or both. This place might benefit from complete
    destruction and a re-build. The smells are, likely, vile.

  name: Lousy
  description: Things are in rough shape. Most structures seem unsound, or are just
    in poor condition. Windows, if there are any, may be broken or boarded up. Walls
    are stained, and streets are rutted or cracked. The smells are an affront to the
    senses.

  name: Moderate
  description: Structures seem sound enough though are, perhaps, not attractive. It
    is likely that most homes keep occupants dry. Roads are relatively clear, if not
    clean. The smells are not pleasant, but tolerable.

  name: Robust
  description: Buildings in the town appear solid. Beams protruding from structure
    walls look to be sturdy and hard-wearing. While possibly lacking in true refinement,
    the town bears a strength and sense of reliability. Roads are maintained, though
    not obsessed over, and are largely free of refuse and filth. The smells are those
    of smoke and sawdust, leather and sweat.

  name: Superb
  description: The town is exemplary in all aspects. The buildings are built with
    exquisite skill and flair, leaving no doubt as to their quality. The roads are
    immaculately kept, with little to no detritus anywhere. The smells are those of
    fresh air and flowers, grass and trees, or cool sea mist.
