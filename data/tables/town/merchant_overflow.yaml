  description: Excess vendors are allowed to set up stalls but, as the town guard
    do not patrol or monitor these areas, the risk is higher. The spaces available

  description: Excess vendors are encouraged to set up stalls outside the town, if
    they are unable to get a spot in the square. There are maintained areas available
    for use, and provided on a first-come, first-served basis. When in use by vendors,
    this area is regularly patrolled, if law enforcement personnel can be spared.
